Binary Search can be implemented in any monotonus function.
A Monotonus function is a function which is stricly increasing of strictly decreasing.

Example - 
f(x) = x^2;		As value of x increases the the value of f(x) increases.

1 2 3 4 97 542 1 14 ...This is not a monotonus function.

1 2 4 7 9 15 5 6 .....This is a monotonus function and binary search can be implemented

Search Space --- >>

It is range in which the binary search has to be implemented.
